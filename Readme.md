# Clipboard Tracker

# Usage

`py main.py`

# Description

The script will save everything that you have copied to the "clipboard{current date}.txt" file. Also, if you wish, you can enter text in the NEW_TEXT variable, which the script will replace in the clipboard if it detects copying an email address (regular expressions are used). If you do not need this, then just leave the variable empty.
